## This folder pertains to the framework of submit folders

To organise the production of this LENTIS, we generate job submit folders for each ensemble member (each run) individually, with their respective settings. This helps to keep an overview of the 320 runs in this ensemble. Also, this helps to track the runs and trace back when a run fails and need to be resubmitted. 

Large Ensemble preparations for running the simulations: 
- Generatate a folder structure with run submit folder for each individual ensemble member
- Add in some extra/external scripts to all these folders later
