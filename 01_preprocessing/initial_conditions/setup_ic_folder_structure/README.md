README about logic behind setting up a softlink file structure for the IC files

### Content 

The scripts in this folder serve two purposes: 
- organise the parent IC files and tailor the folder structure to our needs
- set up a framework that softlinks/symlinks the unperturbed IC files to the right ensemble member

### 01 Untar parent IC files


### 02 Make symlink folders

### 03 Remove symlink folders (if something went wrong)
